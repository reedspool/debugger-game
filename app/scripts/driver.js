 * Stay calm. Everything is okay.

 * Breath. In. Out. Softly now. Softer.

 * You are reading. It's okay. It's normal.
 *
 * Lots of people read.
 *
 * I read.
 *
 * You are now continuing to read. That is great! 
 *
 * More specificly, you are reading SOURCE CODE.
 *
 * Source code is any instruction that both 
 * 
 * a human (that's YOU!) and a computer (that's me)
 *
 * can read. That's right. You just learned something.
 *
 * Get used to it. Both the learning and the reading.
 *
 * A life without reading is a life without learning.
 *
 * Reading source code is important.

 *
 * If none of that made sense to you, GREAT! 
 *
 * You are in the right place.

 *
 *
 *
 *
 * This whole file has LOTS of new lines. Get used to it.
